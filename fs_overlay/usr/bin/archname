#/bin/sh
# Usage: archname.sh <PACKAGE>
#
# Outputs the correct architecture string for the named package, translating
# between the different platform strings. The nice things about standards…
# PACKAGE is one of "s6-overlay" or "docker-gen"
#
# Reads the docker architecture from $TARGETPLATFORM (set by `docker buildx
# build`) and outputs the appropriate per-package architecture name. If
# $TARGETPLATFORM is unset (using legacy `docker build`), it is determined from
# the output for `arch`, which is unreliable in case it is run in an emulator.
# If you really plan to build inside an emulator with the legacy build process,
# you are on your own.

# Notes:
# - nginx:1.19.6 does not support linux/arm/v6
# - `arch` output as reported potentially inside the emulater with
#   `docker buildx build --builder docker-multiarch --platform ...`
# - Assuming linux/arm/v5 and linux/arm/v6 are user-level compatible (for
#   S6 Overlay and Docker-Gen)
# - Assuming Docker-Gen armhf is user-level compatible with linux/arm64/v8
# - Apparently, linux/arm64 and linux/arm64/v8 are used interchangeably

# This is only used for `docker build`, so we should not run inside the
# emulator:
